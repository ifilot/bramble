:program:`Bramble` is a single atom pattern recognition algorithm based on the
:ref:`Common Neighbor Analysis method <background>`. It can efficiently construct
:ref:`CNA fingerprints <background>` per atom and connect these fingerprints
to a (customizable) :ref:`pattern library <pattern library>` to
add labels to the fingerprints. Complimentary scripts are available for easy
visualization in `Blender <https://www.blender.org/>`_ and/or
`Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_.

:program:`Bramble` has been developed at the Eindhoven University of Technology,
Netherlands. :program:`Bramble` and its development are hosted on `github
<https://github.com/ifilot/bramble>`_.  Bugs and feature
requests are ideally submitted via the `github issue tracker
<https://github.com/ifilot/bramble/issues>`_.
