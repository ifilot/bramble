Common Neighbor Analysis
------------------------

The Common Neighbor Analysis (CNA) method is a pattern recognition algorithm for
single atoms. [1] A unique fingerprint is assigned to each atom
based on its atomic environment. It can act as an effective method to
distinguish between active sites and/or facets for crystalline systems.
[2] Various flavours of the CNA algorithm exist:

* **Conventional CNA**
    Based on a pre-fixed cut-off distance the neighbors for
    each atom are collected. This cut-off distance depends on the type of
    crystal lattice that one studies.
* **Adaptive CNA**
    Rather than specifying a fixed cut-off distance, in the
    adaptive algorithm the optimal cutoff radius is automatically determined
    for each individual particle. [3]
* **Interval CNA**
    When a suitable cutoff is challenging to determine using
    conventional or adaptive CNA, especially at high temperatures, the Interval
    Common Neighbor Analysis (i-CNA) method [4] can be
    employed. i-CNA examines all potential threshold choices for each particle,
    making it slower but achieving a higher recognition rate compared to other
    methods.
* **Bond-based CNA**
    Within this flavour the CNA is on the particle network's
    existing bonds, without considering particle distance or using a cutoff
    radius. To use this mode, particles must have pre-defined bonds.

.. note::
   :program:`Bramble` uses an **adaptive CNA** based on the implementation of
   Reinhart and coworkers [5]
   and first documented in the work of van Etten
   [6].

Within :program:`Bramble`, the cut-off distance for an atom is determined
based on the distances with the six nearest neighbors according to the
following equation

.. math::

   r_{\text{cut}} = \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \left( \frac{1}{6} \sum_{j=1}^{6} | \vec{r}_{ij} | \right).

Based on this cut-off distance, all the neighbors of the atom are determined
and based on these atoms a binary adjacency matrix is constructed wherein each
element is a ``1`` if the distance between those atoms is smaller than
:math:`r_{\text{cut}}` or a ``0`` otherwise. This adjacency matrix is essentially
a representation of the neighborhood graph between the atoms. For each node in
this neighborhood graph a triplet of values, i.e. the so-called CNA
indices, is assigned. These indices are:

1. The number of nearest neighbor nodes.
2. The number of edges connecting those nodes to each other.
3. The length of the longest continuous path among those edges.

Finally, the indices of each node are collected and a fingerprint is constructed
based on how many times each CNA triplet is found within the graph.

We here provide an example for a low-coordinated surface atom at the Co
(11-21) interface. (see image below) This an atom has 6 neighbors based on
the value of :math:`r_{\text{cut}}`.

    Schematic depiction of the CNA algorithm. (1) Geometry of the Co
    (11-21) surface termination. For the highlighted atom, the CNA
    fingerprint is going to be determined. Based on the cutoff distance, this
    atom has six neighbors as indicated by the circles. (2) For these
    neighbors, an adjacency matrix is constructed. For each off-diagonal
    element in this matrix a value of one is assigned if the distance the
    corresponding two neighbors is less than the cutoff distance. If not, the
    element has a value of zero.  (3) For each node in the adjacency matrix,
    a triplet of CNA indices is determined corresponding to (i) the number of
    nearest neighbor nodes, (ii) the number of edges connecting those nodes
    to each other, and (iii) the length of the longest continuous path among
    those edges.

From the graph (image 3), we can readily see that for the six nearest neighbors
there are five different types of nodes.

* Two of these nodes, colored in fuchsia, have the (2,0,0) CNA indices. As can
  be readily seen, these nodes only have two neighboring nodes and none of
  these neighboring nodes have any edges shared among them. Thus, the longest
  continuous path has to amount to zero edges.
* The teal node with the CNA indices (3,1,1) has three neighbors(fuchsia, blue
  and green), a single edge is shared among these neighbors (green-blue) and
  the longest continuous path thus amounts to one edge.
* The green node with the CNA indices (3,2,2) has three neighbors (teal, blue
  and yellow). There are two edges shared among these three neighbors
  (teal-blue and yellow-blue). The longest continuous path among these
  neighbors starts at the yellow node, going to the blue node and ending at
  the teal node, thus corresponding to two edges.
* The yellow node with the CNA indices (2,1,1) has two neighbors (green and
  blue) for which one edge (green-blue) is shared among these neighbors. The
  longest continuous path among these neighbors is 1.
* Finally the blue node with the CNA indices (4,2,2) has four neighbors
  (fuchsia, teal, green and yellow). Among these neighbors, two edges are
  shared (teal-green and green-yellow). The longest continuous path for these
  neighbors starts at the yellow node, goes to the green node and ends at the
  teal node.

Counting the number of unique CNA triplets and collecting them into a single
string representation yields ``1(4,2,2)1(3,2,2)1(3,1,1)1(2,1,1)2(2,0,0)``.

.. note::
   There is no strict convention on how the multiplets of CNA indices are ordered
   in the fingerprint construction. :program:`Bramble` orders them in
   descending fashion based on the string representation of the CNA triplet.
   For example, ``(4,2,2)`` precedes ``(4,2,1)``. In this ordering, the
   multiplicity, i.e. the number of atoms having a particular CNA triplet, is
   **not** used.

Below, a list of CNA patterns is given for very common
surface terminations and bulk atoms is given.

   * - Structure
     - CNA pattern
   * - FCC bulk
     - 12(4,2,1)
   * - HCP bulk
     - 6(4,2,2)6(4,2,1)
   * - FCC(111)
     - 3(4,2,1)6(3,1,1)
   * - FCC(100)
     - 4(4,2,1)4(2,1,1)

.. warning::
   Different program might adopt different CNA triplet sorting routines and/or
   different cut-off distances. It is expected that CNA patterns are similar
   between different programs, but no such guarantee can be given. Always
   critically check upon the underlying algorithm when comparing the CNA
   patterns between different programs.

Similarity Analysis
-------------------

Similarity analysis is done in :program:`Bramble` by means of calculating
the minimum `Hilbert-Schmidt norm <https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hilbert-SchmidtNorm.html>`_.
Consider the distance matrix of the nearest
neighbors of two atoms which are to be compared. These distance matrices are
based on those neighboring atoms which have a distance less than the cutoff
distance as defined above.

To determine the similarity between the two atoms, the following value is
calculated

.. math::

   \mu_{kl} = \min_{P} \left( \sqrt{\sum_{ij} \left|\mathbf{D}_{ij}^{(k)} - \mathbf{D}_{ij}^{(l)}\right|^{2}} \right)

wherein the minimum is determined for all permutations :math:`P` for a given
matrix and wherein :math:`\mathbf{D}_{ij}^{(k)}` and :math:`\mathbf{D}_{ij}^{(l)}`
are the distance matrices of the neighboring atoms of atoms :math:`k` and
:math:`l`, respectively.

Because establishing the minimum Hilbert-Schmidt norm is inherently tied to
a graph isomorphism problem, :program:`Bramble` executes a brute-force technique
to probe all possible permutations :math:`P` to ensure that the minimum is found.
